# Web application for recognizing vehicle number plates over GCP

Automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) is a technology that uses optical character recognition (OCR) to automatically identify and read vehicle license plate numbers. ANPR is often used for various applications, such as visitor and car park access management, vehicle theft prevention, security surveillance, and smart parking systems.

In recent years, the use of ANPR has grown significantly, driven by several trends and challenges. One of the major drivers is the increasing prevalence of vehicle thefts, which has led organizations to seek out effective solutions for tracking and identifying vehicles. Additionally, security concerns and the need for efficient and reliable access management have also contributed to the popularity of ANPR.

The use of deep learning and cloud computing has played a key role in the development and deployment of ANPR solutions. Deep learning algorithms, which are a subset of machine learning, have significantly improved the accuracy and reliability of OCR technology, enabling ANPR systems to accurately recognize and read license plate numbers in various conditions and environments. Cloud computing, on the other hand, has enabled organizations to deploy and scale ANPR solutions quickly and easily, without the need for expensive infrastructure and maintenance costs.

Overall, the combination of deep learning and cloud computing has greatly enhanced the capabilities and effectiveness of ANPR, making it an increasingly popular solution for organizations across various industries.
